This is a simple program to tell you what to do.  There are a lot of web solutions to this, but it's tedious to make a schedule for your "free time".  Not only that, but what are the odds to you sticking to the schedule?  In my experience, not good.  You tell tasker how important something is to you (Assign a weight to it), and how long you would like to spend on it should it come up.

Then it picks a semi-random activity, but the weights will determine the probability of a given activity.  When your time on that is done, it spits out a new activity.
